Data Cleaning:
1) Consider cleaning up rare instances in categorical features.  Below is a code example from: https://github.com/rexcoleman/GeneralizedDataScienceFramework-Titanic/blob/main/titanic-generalizeddatascienceframework.ipynb

#cleanup rare title names
#print(data1['Title'].value_counts())
stat_min = 10 #while small is arbitrary, we'll use the common minimum in statistics: http://nicholasjjackson.com/2012/03/08/sample-size-is-10-a-magic-number/
title_names = (data1['Title'].value_counts() < stat_min) #this will create a true false series with title name as index

#apply and lambda functions are quick and dirty code to find and replace with fewer lines of code: https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/tutorial/pandas-groupby-and-python-lambda-functions/
data1['Title'] = data1['Title'].apply(lambda x: 'Misc' if title_names.loc[x] == True else x)
print(data1['Title'].value_counts())
print("-"*10)


Data Encoding:

1) Consider implementing this encoding practice

Categorical data can be divided into two main types: ordinal and nominal. Understanding the difference between these types is crucial when selecting the appropriate encoding method for machine learning.

Nominal Data:
Nominal data refers to categories that do not have an inherent order or ranking among them. Each category is distinct and separate from the others, and there is no logical way to order them.

Examples of Nominal Data:

Colors (Red, Green, Blue)
Types of animals (Dog, Cat, Bird)
Cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago)
Key Characteristics:

No natural order or ranking.
Categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
Numeric encoding of these categories should not imply any order.
Encoding Method:

One-Hot Encoding: This method creates a binary column for each category. For example, if you have a "Color" feature with three categories ("Red," "Green," "Blue"), one-hot encoding will create three binary columns.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {'Color': ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Red']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# One-Hot Encoding
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Color'])
print(df_encoded)
Ordinal Data:
Ordinal data refers to categories that have a meaningful order or ranking among them. However, the differences between the categories are not necessarily uniform or measurable.

Examples of Ordinal Data:

Education levels (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD)
Satisfaction ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent)
Rankings (First, Second, Third)
Key Characteristics:

Natural order or ranking among categories.
The relative differences between categories are not necessarily equal.
Numeric encoding should reflect the order but not imply exact distances.
Encoding Method:

Label Encoding: This method assigns an integer value to each category based on their order. For ordinal data, this method is suitable because it preserves the order of the categories.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Sample data
data = {'Education': ['High School', 'Bachelor', 'Master', 'PhD']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Label Encoding
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['Education_Encoded'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Education'])

print(df)
Summary:
Nominal Data: Categories without a natural order. Example encoding method: One-Hot Encoding.
Ordinal Data: Categories with a natural order. Example encoding method: Label Encoding.
Why This Distinction Matters:
Choosing the correct encoding method is crucial because:

Nominal Data: Encoding should not introduce an artificial order. One-hot encoding is typically used to avoid implying any order among categories.
Ordinal Data: Encoding should preserve the inherent order. Label encoding is suitable because it maintains the order of categories.
Using the wrong encoding method can lead to misleading results and affect the performance of the machine learning model. For example, applying label encoding to nominal data can introduce unintended ordinal relationships, while using one-hot encoding for ordinal data can ignore the natural order.
